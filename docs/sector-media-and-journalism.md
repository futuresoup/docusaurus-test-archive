The influence of media and journalism can drive systemic change, mobilize public support, and hold those in power accountable for their actions or inactions related to climate change.

A strong fearless media will allow us to:

* Communicate the urgency of the climate crisis
* Hold large powerful institutions accountable for telling the truth and acting with integrity.
* Shaping policy and public opinion
